        <p>My name is Martin and I'm a recent Mathematics graduate from the University of Waterloo. The best part about Waterloo is it let me try several careers before graduating: accounting, consulting, and finance. Luckily, I fell in love with tech!</p>
        <p>Working at Facebook, along with joining the prestigious Next 36 program, took me down a whirlwind path of entrepreneurship and technology. Over the past year, I've worked with a team of amazing Waterloo grads on two startups: Versionly and Practicure.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.versionly.com">Versionly</a> is version control for PowerPoint! We created this to solve a problem I faced everyday in several jobs: not knowing what changed in the latest PowerPoint presentation. Anyone can simply cc: team@versionly.com when sharing a PPT over email, and Versionly automatically tracks the changes!<br><br><br><br><br>  </p>

            <p><a href="http://www.practicure.com">PractiCure</a> is a device that helps dentists increase the lifespan of their cavity fillings by up to 10 years! My co-founder had several years of experience in dental where he identified this problem. We even garnered enough attention to receive a cease and desist from a competitor,just 4 weeks in!</p>

        <p>Speaking of adventures, I love sports: mountain biking, running, tennis, and even dodgeball. You name it, I play it.</p> 
        <p>I also volunteer and help out others any chance I get (including up-and-coming entrepreneurs). Reach out to me anytime.</p>
